# tandem_repeats

This repository contains codes to accompany the reading of the article "MEGASATELLITE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION IN VERTEBRATES".  

You will find all the scripts used to instantiate our database of vertebrate genomic tandem repeats, as well as a patch for [gepard] (https://cube.univie.ac.at/gepard) to allow it to visualise the exons.
